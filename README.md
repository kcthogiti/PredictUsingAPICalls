# PredictUsingAPICalls
This is an example which shows building a machine learning model, using the model objects and predict values by making API calls


The objective of this project is to do the following
	1. Build a simple classification model using the iris data
	2. Pickle the model objects
	3. Create a REST API using python Flask that uses the pickled objects and predicts the class for test data based on an API request made using JSON data

	
Following packages are used:
	1. numpy, pandas for data manipulations
	2. sklearn for importing the dataset and build Logistic Regression models
	3. pickle to pickle the python model objects
	4. Flask to create a simple REST API

I have also included a sample test file that can be used when making API requests.
